# Personalizing the agent
{: #personalize}

Ensure that the virtual agent responds to the issues that matter to your customers. And that its responses accurately convey information about the services that your company offers or help customers complete business transactions.
{: shortdesc}

You can personalize the agent by performing the following actions:

- [Adding custom dialogs for core capabilities](add-custom-dialog.html)
- [Adding your own capabilities](add-custom-capabilities.html)

You must link a workspace to the agent before you can configure the agent to use artifacts from it. See [Linking workspaces](link_workspace.html) for more information.
